# Go Programming Demo

A simple application developed using Golang, this demonstrates basic CRUD functions.
# Run the application
```
1. Open 'http://localhost:8080' on browser.
2. Application is using PostgreSQL 'postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/library?sslmode=disable'.
3. Schema and data scripts are located under 'sql' directory.
```
```
Everything is inspired by Todd McCleod's Golang online courses.
